# experiment: color and time of day

The main file with all the content is color_time.ipynb

Between April and May 2021, my classmate and I ran an experiment to determine the correlation between color preferences and times of day as part of our class on the psychology of aesthetics and design. We measured 400+ participant's preferences for chroma (saturation) and brightness (value) for 6 different hues at different times of day over the course of a few days.
